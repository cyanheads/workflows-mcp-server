    description: "Translate the enriched seed data into a visual medium. This creates the foundational layer of your knowledge graph. A central node representing the core research topic is created, and all initial 'seed' articles are linked to it. This establishes the initial thematic landscape. Seed nodes are colored blue."

    action: "Phase 4.1 (Loop Start): Iterative Network Expansion"
    description: >-
      This is the start of the core research loop.
      **Your task as the agent is to analyze the current graph and strategically select the next node to expand.**
      1.  **Analyze the Graph**: Identify nodes that are highly connected, central to a cluster, or particularly relevant to the core research question.
      2.  **Select a Strategy**: Based on your analysis, choose a `relationshipType`. Use 'pubmed_citedin' to find influential papers, 'pubmed_references' to uncover foundational work, or 'pubmed_similar_articles' to broaden thematic clusters.
      3.  **Execute**: Call this tool with the prioritized PMID and the chosen relationship type.
      This step should be repeated to build out the graph iteratively.
    params:
      sourcePmid: "{{a_highly_relevant_PMID_from_the_current_graph}}"
      relationshipType: "{{'pubmed_citedin' | 'pubmed_references' | 'pubmed_similar_articles'}}"
      maxRelatedResults: 15

    tool: fetch_pubmed_content
    action: "Phase 4.2: Expansion Data Enrichment"
    description: "Enrich the newly discovered articles from the expansion. Fetch their full details to ensure every new node added to the graph is information-rich."
    params:

    tool: cosmograph_add_elements
    action: "Phase 4.3: Augment Graph with Expanded Network"
    description: "Integrate the enriched findings from the expansion into the visualization. This is where the graph breathes and grows. Each new article is added as a node, and a labeled link is created from the source article, clearly showing the relationship (e.g., 'cited by', 'references', 'similar to'). Use distinct visual cues for each expansion 'hop' to represent the growth of your understanding (e.g., Hop 1 nodes are yellow, Hop 2 are green)."

    action: "Phase 4.4 (Loop End): Reframe, Analyze, and Decide"
    description: >-
      This is the end of one loop iteration. After reframing the view, you must perform a strategic review.
      **Your task as the agent is to decide the next action:**
      1.  **Analyze the new graph structure**: Look for emerging clusters, new central nodes, and gaps in the research landscape.
      2.  **Evaluate against the goal**: Does the graph sufficiently answer the research question?
      3.  **Decide**:
          - **CONTINUE**: If more exploration is needed, identify the next set of nodes to prioritize and return to step 4.1.
          - **CONCLUDE**: If the graph is sufficiently rich or the research goal is met, proceed to the final phase to synthesize your findings for the user.

    action: "Phase 5: Final Synthesis and Notification"
    description: >-
      The iterative research is complete. Your final task is to synthesize the findings from the visual knowledge graph and present them to the user.
      1.  **Summarize Key Findings**: Describe the main thematic clusters, identify the most influential papers (based on connectivity), and explain the overall structure of the literature as revealed by the visualization.
      2.  **Notify the User**: Send a notification that the research is complete, including a link to the interactive graph and a brief summary of the key insight.
      3.  **Present Full Report**: Use `attempt_completion` to provide the detailed summary report.
